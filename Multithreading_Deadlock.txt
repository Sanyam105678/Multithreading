-> Deadlock is the state when 2 or more threads are waiting for object lock holded by one another. In this scenario 1st thread is waiting
for the object lock acquired by 2nd thread, where 2nd thread is waiting for the object lock acquired by the 1st thread. This situation is 
called Deadlock in Multithreading, it is just a case of infinite wait.

-> A multithreaded application suffers from the deadlock because the synchronized keyword. Synchronised keyword makes the application thread
safe it means at a time only one thread can apply lock of synochronised method and execute it, during this time other threads must wait till 
the lock is released. but in this scenerio if that 1st thread wants to execute that method locked by one of the waiting threads of the method on 
which 1st thread has applied lock, then it causes deadlock.
